# lkc-pwbi-datamart-flow

This solution aims to ingest data from production Power BI Datamart (Azure SQL databse generated by a datamart) feature, perform simple transformations and load it to SQL Server and AWS S3 bucket.

This solution is useful when you need to retrieve data that has already been transformed or prepared in Power BI for storage in another data repository.
